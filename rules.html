	<h1>Rules</h1>
	
	<h2>For Confessions</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Don’t post anything that violates any relevant laws or the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards">Facebook Community Standards.</a></li>
		<li>Remember that this is a forum for anonymous confessions. Please don't ask general school questions if there's no reason you would need/want to be anonymous. <a href="http://google.com/">Google</a>, of course, is a good resource (especially if you use the <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/136861?hl=en">site:</a> operator to restrict your search to ucsc.edu), as are the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/229965327018211/">“Official” Group of UCSC Students</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/groupsatucsc/">Groups at UCSC</a>.</li>
		<li>No URLs.</li>
		<li>Don’t submit posts that consist entirely of verbatim quotes from other sources.</li>
		<li>No commerce of any kind.</li>
		<li>It’s fine to put your email address in a confession, but only if it’s really yours. No other forms of contact information are allowed.</li>
		<li>Don’t advertise parties.</li>
		<li>Posts that are spammy, unintelligble, typed in ALL CAPS, or devoid of content will not be posted.</li>
		<li>Don’t discuss shitting in someone’s mouth or any related acts. Before you ask, yes, this has been an issue and that’s why there’s a rule about it.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>For Comments</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Don’t be abusive towards other commenters.</li>
		<li>Don’t post spam.</li>
	</ul>

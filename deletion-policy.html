	<h1>Deletion Policy</h1>
	
	<h2>For Confessions</h2>
	
	<p>If you have a problem with a post, please send a Facebook message to the page or email <a href="mailto:administrator@ucsantacruzconfessions.com">administrator@ucsantacruzconfessions.com</a> rather than reporting the post to Facebook so we can try to resolve the situation. Be sure to include a link to the offending post. I generally will only delete posts in one of two situations:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>The post is in violation of the law, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards">Facebook Community Standards</a>, or my <a href="/rules.html">rules</a>. I often skim the submissions before posting, and offensive material sometimes slips through the cracks.</li>
		<li>If you want a post that mentions your name deleted, I’ll delete it irregardless of its other content.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>For Comments</h2>
	
	<p>Since Facebook doesn’t hold me responsible for comments, I generally recommend simply reporting offensive comments to Facebook. However, feel free to message the page or email <a href="mailto:administrator@ucsantacruzconfessions.com">administrator@ucsantacruzconfessions.com</a> in cases of spam or a commenter repeatedly and consistently abusing other commenters in multiple instances. Please include links to relevant posts.</p>

	<p>Bans are taken very seriously and are rarely applied. Lenience increases down this list:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>Profiles clearly created solely for posting spam comments are killed on sight.</li>
		<li>Profiles or pages with a fake identity are given the benefit of the doubt.</li>
		<li>Profiles with real identities but that don’t belong to UCSC affiliates will be banned if they’re being severly disruptive.</li>
		<li>Profiles with real identities that belong to UCSC students are rarely, if ever, banned.</li>
	</ol>

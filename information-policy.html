	<h1>Information Policy</h1>
	
	<p>This server, like all other web servers, logs the IP addresses of all computers that interact with it. This information is recorded for purely diagnostic and security purposes.</p>

	<p>For the sake of protecting the anonymity of confessors, no attempt is made to associate IP addresses with individual confessions.</p>
	
	<p>Aside from the publication of confessions on the page, no information will be released to law enforcement or any other party unless a valid subpoena is served.</p>

	<h2 id="email">Email Relay</h2>
	
	<p>To allow others to email you while still remaining anonymous yourself, enter your email address into the “Contact email” box when writing a confession. When posted, your confession will include an @ucsantacruzconfessions.com address. Any emails sent to this address will be relayed to you.</p>
	
	<p><strong>If you respond to any of these emails, you will no longer be anonymous and whoever you responded to will now see your real email address.</strong> The relay service is provided only so you can selectively decide who to make first contact with; it is not an anonymous chat service. On that same token, anyone <em>sending</em> emails to @ucsantacruzconfessions.com addresses will not be anonymous either.</p>
	
	<p>Your relay will expire after 14 days. This is for two reasons:</p>
	
	<ol>
		<li>To prevent the page from becoming a harvesting ground for spammers</li>
		<li>To protect your anonymity; your email address will not be kept on record after your relay expires.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>If you wish to have your relay terminated sooner than 14 days, please email <a href="mailto:administrator@ucsantacruzconfessions.com">administrator@ucsantacruzconfessions.com</a>.</p>

	<p>Relayed emails will be stripped down to plain text, so don't bother using fancy formatting or sending attachments.</p>

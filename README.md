[UC Santa Cruz Confessions](https://www.facebook.com/UCSantaCruzConfessions)
was a Facebook page that allowed UCSC students to anonymously post
about ([almost](rules.html)) anything they wanted. I started the page in
December 2012, and within months it grew to over 8,000 likes and averaged
around one hundred daily submissions. I retired the page in June 2014.

To protect anonymity, all confessions were posted by the page itself. Early
on, I collected confessions through Survey Monkey; once the page outgrew
that, I threw together a website and hosted it on my roommate's server.
Eventually, I redesigned the site (what you see here) and moved it to
[ucsantacruzconfessions.com](http://ucsantacruzconfessions.com).

I never got around to automating the posting system, or hooking with the
Facebook API, but I did add a Craigslist-esque email relay system that
allowed confessors to anonymously receive email. Note that the site was
developed without version control, so the git history won't tell you
much.

I'm releasing the site's source code under the Apache License. (I
should've done that when I retired the page, but the thought didn't
occur to me until recently). The master branch contains the site's code as
it was when the page was active; the [disabled](../disabled) branch
reflects the site's current state.

I don't intend to work on this any further, but if you have any questions,
contact me at administrator@ucsantacruzconfessions.com.
